# Advent of Code 2023 👨🏼‍💻 🎄 λ

Implemented in **F#**

I'm using VSCode Polyglot notebooks this year, which you should be able to view directly in GitHub by clicking on the various `.ipynb` files.

If you'd like to play around with these notebooks locally, you will just need to ensure you have the VSCode [Polyglot Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension installed.
